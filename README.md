gitstats - analytics for Open Source
---------------------
![Gitstats dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JacquesPerrault/jacquesperrault.github.io/master/images/gitstats_kibana_screenshot.jpg)
# Overview

<strong>gitstats</strong> reads GitHub data and feeds structured data to an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

# Usage
```
NOTE: as of version 0.3.0, these options will be ignored.  Gitstats will automatically launch with the --deletedb option, 
and will cycle once an hour during steady-state operations using the -c option.  The code to use these option is present,
just commented out.

node app.js [option]

Options:
        -c, --collect   create a database (if necessary) and collect stats 
                          generated since the last run
        --deletedb      re-create the database and collect stats
        -h, --help      print help (this message)
```
# Configuration
<strong>gitstats</strong> requires you to use a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) 
## Update the configuration file
Make a copy of `config-sample.js` and name it `config.js`.
Open `config.js` in a text editor and update as described below:
```
'orgsfile': './orgs-sample.json',   [point at your org file, see 'Create an org file']
'collect_commits': true,            [true or false]
'collect_pull_requests': true,      [true or false]
'collect_stargazers': true,         [true or false]
'interval_git': 1000,               [github processing interval in milliseconds
                                     anything faster than 1000ms may cause GitHub to flag
                                     your account for rate-limit violations]
'interval_db': 100,                 [database processing interval in milliseconds
                                     anything faster than 100ms my cause timeouts
                                     when using a remote database
'port': 80,                         [gitstats application port]
'host': 'localhost',                [gitstats application host]
'db': {                             [this section is for NoSQL db]
    'name': 'sample',               [db name - NOTE: this will also be the name of your
                                     ElasticSearch index and logstash.conf]
    'host': 'localhost',            [host]
    'port': 5984                    [port]
    'protocol': 'https:',           [protocol]
    'user': '',                     [username (basic auth)]
    'password': ''                  [password (basic auth)]
},
'git': {
    'hostname': 'api.github.com',
    'port': 443,
    'protocol': 'https:',
    'personaltoken': ''             [GitHub personal access token]
}

```
## Create an org file
Make a copy of `orgs-sample.json`.  Name it whatever you like, but be sure to
update the `orgsfile` setting in `config.js`.
Open your org file in a text editor, and update it as described below.

<strong>gitstats</strong> is capable of reading stats from GitHub *organizations*, *users*, or *repositories*.
*organizations* and *users* are collections of one or more *repositories*.
<strong>gitstats</strong> will automatically enumerate *organizations* and *users* so
long as you specify the correct `type`, as demonstrated below:
```
[
    {"name":"Open-I-Beam", "type":"org"},
    {"name":"ibm-bioinformatics", "type":"user"},
    {"name":"cognitive-catalyst/cognitive-catalyst", "type":"repo"},
]
```

## Run the gitstats collector
<strong>note:</strong> You will also need to reset the logstash sequence path each time the database is reset.  
This is stored in a file located in the `\bin` directory of you logstash deployment, and will
be named according to the value of the `sequence_path` attribute contained in `logstash-sample.conf`.

## Set up the middleware
<strong>gitstats</strong> requires the following middleware/services:
<ul>
<li>[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) v4.2.1+</li>
<li>[ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) v2.1+</li>
<li>[LogStash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) v2.1+</li>
<li>[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) v4.3.0+</li>
</ul>

The instructions below assume you run all components locally; however, you may mix and match.  For example, you could run Node, CouchDb, Logstash, and Kibana locally, and point at an ElasticSearch instance in the cloud.

#### 1. Install and run a NoSQL data store
Virtually any NoSQL database will do.  You can either install your own, or point at an existing NoSQL cloud service.
#### 2. Install and run [Elasticsearch]()
You can either install your own, or point at an existing ElasticSearch cloud service.

Create the ElasticSearch index using the following command:
`curl -XPUT http://[Elasticsearch IP]:[port]/sample -d '[paste the contents of dwopen-logstash-index.json]'`

If your instance of ElasticSearch requires basic auth, use this:
`curl -u username -XPUT http://[Elasticsearch IP]:[port]/sample -d '[paste the contents of dwopen-logstash-index.json]'`
Replace `username` with - you guessed it - your ElasticSearch username.  You will be prompted for the password.

NOTE 1: the json file contains line breaks for readability; you will need to remove the linebreaks manually, or with a free online tool such as [Text Fixer](http://www.textfixer.com/tools/remove-line-breaks.php)

NOTE 2: `sample` is the name of the created index and should also be used in `logstash.conf` - refer to the `db:name` parameter in the Configuration section below.
After running the command, you should get a response like this:
`{"acknowledged":true}`

#### 3. Install [Logstash]()
You can either install your own, or point at an existing Logstash cloud service.
Create a logstash.conf file from the template provided (logstash-sample.conf)
#### 4. Install [Kibana]()
You can either install your own, or point at an existing Kibana cloud service.
Be sure to update `\config\kibana.yml` to point it at your ElasticSearch instance

Open Kibana in a browser, then open Settings and then Indices

Click on "Add Index" and enter 'dwopen' - the "Create" button should light up. When it asks for the date field to index on, choose 'doc.date'

Open Settings and then Objects and then import `dwopen-visualizations.json` and then `dwopen-dashboard.json`

Open Dashboard, and load "dWO Dashboard"

If you don't see any data, change the timeframe by clicking the timer in the upper right corner of the dashboard.
